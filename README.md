# Ecotomata

A small game based on the forest-fire cellular-automaton [as presented by Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/sim/). Assets are mostly stolen from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/).

## Building
Made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) v4.3, which hopefully means you can simply clone this repo and open it in Godot.

## Todo
- [ ] Add github description
- [ ] Figure out how to host this on github pages
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Playtesting
- [ ] Proper water
- [ ] Sound? Music?
