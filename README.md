# Ecotomata
A small game based on the forest-fire cellular-automaton [as visualized Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/sim/)! Assets are mostly stolen from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/). Nicky's and Kenney's stuff is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), and so is this project ðŸ§¡

This is a birthday gift for a friend.

## Building
Made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) v4.3, which hopefully means you can simply clone this repo and open it in Godot.

## Todo
- [ ] Add github description
- [ ] Add banner.png to Readme.md
- [ ] Figure out how to host this on github pages
	- Once hosted, add link to github and readme
	- If hosting isn't possible, put releases on github
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Playtesting
- [ ] Sound? Music?
- [ ] Have orbs disappear eventually
